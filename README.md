iPhone Calculator Clone Project with Swift


Hello everyone, I am currently learning swift and I made this iPhone Calculator Clone App with programmatic UI
Everything's working fine, I checked some technical calculating problems and fixed them.
I will be happy if you feedback to me about the problems which you found in the app.

I hope you enjoy that :)
